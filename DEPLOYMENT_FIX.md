# Fixing the Authentication 404 Error

Hello! Based on the screenshot you provided, the authentication process is failing because of a configuration issue with your hosting environment, not a bug in the application code itself. Here's a breakdown of the problem and how to fix it.

## The Problem

The screenshot shows a "404 Not Found" page from your hosting provider (like Vercel, Netlify, etc.). This happens because:

1.  After you authorize the application with Discord, Discord redirects your browser to the URL `https://24ifr.hasmah.xyz/auth`.
2.  Your frontend hosting service receives this request for the `/auth` path.
3.  The hosting service looks for a file named `auth.html` or a directory named `auth`. It can't find one.
4.  Because it's not configured for a Single Page Application (SPA), it returns a 404 error instead of loading your main `index.html` file.
5.  Since `index.html` never loads, the JavaScript code that is supposed to handle the login process never runs.

The root cause is that the redirect from Discord is pointing to the wrong place. It should point to the backend API, which then securely completes the login and redirects you to the correct frontend page.

## How to Fix It

There are two steps to resolving this permanently.

### Step 1: Correct the Discord Redirect URI (The Main Fix)

This is the most important step. The redirect URI in your Discord application settings must point to the backend callback endpoint.

1.  Go to the **Discord Developer Portal** (https://discord.com/developers/applications).
2.  Select your application.
3.  Go to the **"OAuth2"** page from the left-hand menu.
4.  Under **"Redirects"**, you likely have an entry like `https://24ifr.hasmah.xyz/auth`. You need to **change it** to the full URL of your backend's callback handler. Based on your `traefik_configs.md` file, this should be:
    `https://api.hasmah.xyz/auth/discord/callback`
5.  **Save your changes.**

After making this change, the authentication flow will work as designed:
`Your App -> Discord -> Your Backend -> Your App`

### Step 2: Configure Your Frontend Hosting for SPA Routing (Recommended)

It is also a best practice for any SPA to configure the hosting provider to handle client-side routing. This prevents 404 errors if a user tries to refresh the page on a URL like `/profile`. This involves adding a "rewrite rule" that serves `index.html` for any path that doesn't match a real file.

Here are some examples. You should add a file with this content to your `frontend` directory.

**For Vercel (create a `vercel.json` file):**
```json
{
  "rewrites": [
    { "source": "/((?!api/).*)", "destination": "/index.html" }
  ]
}
```

**For Netlify (create a `_redirects` file):**
```
/*    /index.html   200
```

**For Cloudflare Pages (create a `_redirects` file):**
```
/*    /index.html   200
```

Doing Step 1 should completely fix the login issue. Step 2 is a good practice that will make your application more robust.
