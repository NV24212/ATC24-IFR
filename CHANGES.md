# Code Cleanup Changes

## Overview
This document summarizes the changes made to clean up the codebase, particularly focusing on removing deployment-specific code and optimizing verbose sections.

## Changes Made

### 1. Removed Deployment-Specific Code
- **Vercel References**: Removed all Vercel-specific conditionals and environment checks
- **Repl.co References**: Removed Repl.co-specific redirect URI configuration
- **Serverless Mode**: Eliminated all serverless-specific code paths and conditionals
- **Simplified Server Initialization**: Removed conditional server startup based on deployment environment

### 2. Code Optimizations
- **Logging Function**: Optimized the verbose logging function to be more concise
- **Supabase Initialization**: Simplified the Supabase client initialization with cleaner error handling
- **Flight Plans Retrieval**: Restructured the flight plans endpoint to be more straightforward
- **WebSocket Handling**: Simplified WebSocket connection and reconnection logic

### 3. Health Endpoint Improvements
- **Simplified Status Response**: Removed deployment-specific fields from health and status endpoints
- **Streamlined WebSocket Status**: Simplified WebSocket status reporting

## Testing
All functionality has been tested and verified to be working correctly after the cleanup:
- Server starts successfully
- WebSocket connection works
- Status endpoint returns correct information

## Benefits
- **Improved Maintainability**: Code is now easier to understand and maintain
- **Reduced Complexity**: Removed unnecessary conditionals and deployment-specific logic
- **Better Readability**: More concise code with less verbosity
- **Simplified Deployment**: Single code path regardless of deployment environment
